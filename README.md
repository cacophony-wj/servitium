# SERVITIUM

## "Sub, Dom, whichever you choose -- you're going to kill it."

## Preamble

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.

_SERVITIUM_ was a variant of _Licentia_. It emphasizes an accessible Power Fantasy design philosophy but spices things up a bit with the _SexLab_ Adult Framework and a host of intrusive fetish content. The list accommodates either female submissive gameplay or male, female, or futanari dominant gameplay via an easy-to-use Dropdown Menu.

It is currently on hiatus due to the author's health difficulties.

#### More Information

If you want to examine a really old list of the mods in this modlist, [go here.](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/servitium-1) 

### System Specifications

The recommended setup for an enjoyable experience **at 1080p** is at least

- intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 5 5000 or later
- NVIDIA RTX 2070 SUPER or AMD Radeon 5700 XT or later
- 40GB PAGEFILE, NO EXCEPTIONS


Remember that higher resolutions require more powerful Hardware.

### Requirements

- [Nexus Account](https://nexusmods.com/)
- [LoversLab Account](https://www.loverslab.com/)

These accounts are mandatory, they must be created before continuing.

## Pre-Installation

Before you do anything with _Wabbajack,_ ensure that _Skyrim_ is installed in a non-protected folder.

The _Lover's Lab API_ (automatic download interface) is no longer available due to technical considerations, so it is recommended that all mods from there be downloaded from a normal web browser.

You can find a list of such mods to download in [this document](DOWNLOADS.md).

## Installation

For _Wabbajack_ to match its files, _Skyrim_ needs to be set to the English language. 

_Servitium_ requires the additional _Creation Club Content_ from the _Skyrim Anniversary Edition Upgrade_ or the modlist will not install.

Ensure you have set antivirus exceptions for this folder, the _Skyrim_ vanilla game folder, and the _Wabbajack_ folder, or the installation will fail.

Ensure that _OneDrive_ is uninstalled.

The _Microsoft Visual C++_ redistributable package is required. Download the x64 version of "Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2022" [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

You must set your Advanced Memory Pagefile to at least 40GB or the modlist will constantly crash. 

You must launch the _Skyrim Launcher_ at least once or _Wabbajack_ cannot detect the game.

##  Using Wabbajack

Login to _Nexus_ with the _Wabbajack_ app. 

This login can be found by clicking the **GEAR** icon in the top right.

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are many different scenarios where _Wabbajack_ will produce an error. Re-run _Wabbajack_ before seeking assistance. 

**Various files beginning with "cc" and ending with "esl" or "esm" failed to download.**

You did not purchase the $20 upgrade to Skyrim, and this is not negotiable. 

**Could not download x:**

Some Internet providers have difficulty accessing the servers hosting the list's files. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) with a terminus set to the United States.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

_Servitium_ will not work with a GOG or pirated game version. If you own the game on _Steam,_ return to the Installation step. 

**MEGA download cap exceeded.**

This shouldn't happen unless you download the list multiple times or download multiple _Wabbajack_ lists. Sign up for an account or wait for the timeout to expire.

## Post-Installation

### Verifying the Modlist

To verify the modlist, launch the _Wabbajack_ app again after installation.

Ensure that all the same settings are used as during the installation process.

Click the **VERIFY** button in the Lower Right Corner of _Wabbajack._

Wait for the process to complete. It can take quite some time.

You **MUST** receive a popup webpage that is **BLANK** with **ZERO ERRORS.**

If you receive **ANY** errors you **MUST** reinstall the list with the "Overwrite" checkbox selected.

**YOU MUST RECEIVE ZERO ERRORS. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.**

## Post-Installation

### Launching the Modlist

Launch ModOrganizer.exe from the directory where you installed the list. 

If you direct your attention to the Dropdown Menu at the top of the left pane, you will find four Profiles to choose from: 

- **SERVITIUM** is intended **ONLY** for female submissive characters and features a lot of intrusive exploitation.
- **SERVITIUM Male** is more about dominant content but can accomodate any gender and features far less intrusive gameplay.
- **SERVITIUM OWS** is also known as "Of Wenches and Succubi" and uses a Suite of Succubus and Wench mods to simulate a Player Transformation into an Immortal Demon who gains superpowers via sex.
- **SERVITIUM PPLUS** is a _highly experimental_ Profile (similar to the main _SERVITIUM_ list) based around the next evolution of _SexLab._

Choose wisely before you begin, because you **cannot switch in the middle of a game.**

Then, launch the game from the **SKSE** entry in the drop-down menu.

### MCM CONFIGURATION

### WHEN YOU SPAWN IN HELGEN'S INN, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!

Wait for all of the messages in the upper left corner of the screen to appear and disappear. 

A warning will be issued that this readme is mandatory for proper installation.

 Click through and continue to wait.

When all of the messages have disappeared, find the Mod Configuration entry for "SexLab AE" (They are in alphabetical order.) 

Click on it, and along the top right, click the option labeled "Install/Update SexLab." Now close the menu and wait for all messages to appear and disappear. 

Reopen the MCM for _SexLab_ and select the "Animations" entry. Click the option that says "Enable Creature Animations." Close and wait for messages.

It is very important at this stage to save and reload the game so SexLab will initialize properly and cache scenes and equipment.

Just a few more steps. 

Open the MCM and find the _ZAZ_ entry at the bottom. Select the "SexLab" option on the left. 

Scroll to the top and select "Register." The entry will gray out. 

Touch nothing until this menu reads "Registered." 

 Now find the _SLAL Anim Loader_ entry. 

Click the "Enable all animations" option. Wait a couple of seconds. 

Click the "Register all animations" option. The process of registering the animations takes about two minutes. If it completes successfully, you should receive a message that over 900 animations are enabled.

 I recommend you close the menu and save now in case something goes wrong in the next step.

Final step. Open Main Menu with the ESC key and find the entry labeled "MCM Recorder." 

Here, you will find an MCM "Recording" labeled simply "RUN ME." 

Click on it, answer "Yes," and use ESC to back out of all menus. 

You will receive a popup asking if you wish to play the recording; please do so.

Once again, please wait for all of the messages in the upper left corner of the screen to appear and disappear. 

**CLICK OK ON ANY DIALOG BOXES. IF YOU RECEIVE ANY ERRORS, CLICK CONTINUE.** 

The whole procedure takes about three minutes. 

That's it! Your modlist is configured. Good luck and may your game-breaking bugs be few in number. 

## FINAL NOTES

**IF YOU FIND YOU ARE NOT HORNY:** Or just want to turn off the sex & bondage and play _Skyrim_ for awhile, run the "XXX OFF" MCM Recording. To re-enable the sex, you will need to run "RUN ME" followed by "XXX ON."

**IF YOU ARE PLAYING SERVITIUM MALE:** You will need to wait a bit longer for a bunch of messages to appear in the Upper Left, just as you did in the starting room.

Lastly, you will need to enable the _Hunter's Pride_ Defeat Menu for Enslavement to work properly. Simply hold the `SCROLL LOCK` key on your keyboard, then press the `PAUSE` key. 

You should see a message up there that reads "Hunter's Pride Enabled."

**IF YOU ARE PLAYING SERVITIUM OWS:** The process to develop your Succubus / Incubus form can be a bit involved. [Refer to this document.](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/servitium/blob/main/Succubus-Form.md)
