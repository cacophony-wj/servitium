## INTRODUCING "OF WENCHES AND SUCCUBI"

#### by Nazarethblood

Do you like wenches? Do you like succubi? Do you like being bent over because a potential follower handed you your ass in combat? Then  look no further. Of Wenches & Succubi (OWS) is an offshoot of the Servitium mod list which adds the full suite of wenches mods, the ability to play as a succubus (or incubus) and a whole host of potential followers for you to find and defat so as to earn their respect and get them tio join you on your journey. 

Wenches have been added to virtually every aspect of the game. From civilized towns and cities, to deadly bandit encouters, to the forgotten halls of the dwemer, to the haunted catacombs of those long deceased. You never know where they might pop up to make your life more entertaining (or difficult).

Having the ability to gain power through sex is a key feature of this profile. Not only can you use sex as a weapon and kill a would be attacker. You also have the option to take on an alternate form which you create yourself. This empowered form is significantly stringer than your mortal form but will sap away your energy and eventually force you to revert back to your normal weaker form. 

Besides the above, the world has also become a lot more dangerous. No longer do most followers sit around and wait for an invitation. They are now out in the world and must be defeated in combat in order to convince them you are worth their time. There is a colorful cast of characters to find and add to your collection. But be warned: Most of these individuals are extremely dangerous and will not go down quietyly.

If this sounds like an experience that you'd enjoy then hop on over to the OWS profile in Servitium and start draining the life out of your enemies. We all know that your affections are to die for...
